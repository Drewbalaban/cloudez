## Remaining TODOs

- [x] Persist FileManager view mode (grid/list) across refresh (e.g., localStorage)

- [x] Prevent blue overscroll background when scrolling (CSS overscroll-behavior/background clamp)
- [x] Show user profile avatar next to their name in the dashboard header
- [ ] Customize Supabase auth emails (reset/create) with site branding and sender
