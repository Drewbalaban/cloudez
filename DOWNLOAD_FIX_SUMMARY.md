# Download Fix for Shared Files - CloudEZ

## Problem Identified

Users could see shared files in the "Shared with me" tab, but when they tried to download them, the download would fail. This was because:

1. **Direct Storage Access**: The original `downloadFile` function tried to access Supabase storage directly
2. **Permission Issues**: Shared users don't have direct access to the storage bucket
3. **Missing Server-Side Validation**: No server-side permission checking for downloads

## Solution Implemented

### 1. New API Endpoint

Created `/api/download/[id]/route.ts` that:
- Validates user authentication
- Checks file access permissions (owner, public, or shared)
- Creates signed URLs with proper permissions
- Handles errors gracefully

### 2. Updated Download Function

Modified `downloadFile` in `FileManager.tsx` to:
- Use the API endpoint for shared files
- Use direct storage access for owned files
- Provide better error messages and user feedback
- Add comprehensive logging for debugging

### 3. Permission Checking

The API endpoint checks three access levels:
1. **Owner Access**: User owns the file
2. **Public Access**: File is marked as public
3. **Shared Access**: File is shared with the user via `file_shares` table

## Files Modified

- `src/app/api/download/[id]/route.ts` - New download API endpoint
- `src/components/FileManager.tsx` - Updated download function
- Added test download button to debug section

## How It Works

### For Shared Files:
1. User clicks download on a shared file
2. Frontend calls `/api/download/[fileId]`
3. API validates user permissions
4. API creates signed URL with proper access
5. Frontend downloads the file using the signed URL

### For Owned Files:
1. User clicks download on their own file
2. Frontend creates signed URL directly from Supabase
3. File downloads immediately

## Testing

1. **Test with Shared Files**:
   - Share a file with another user
   - Have that user navigate to "Shared with me"
   - Click download on the shared file
   - Should download successfully

2. **Test with Owned Files**:
   - Go to "My Files" tab
   - Click download on any file
   - Should download immediately

3. **Test Permissions**:
   - Try to download a file you don't have access to
   - Should get "Access denied" error

## Debug Tools

The debug section now includes:
- **Test Download Button**: Tests download functionality for shared files
- **Console Logging**: Detailed logs for troubleshooting
- **Error Messages**: Clear feedback for users

## Security Features

- **Authentication Required**: All downloads require valid user session
- **Permission Validation**: Server-side checking of file access rights
- **Signed URLs**: Temporary, secure download links
- **Audit Trail**: All download attempts are logged

## Expected Behavior

### Before Fix:
- ❌ Shared file downloads failed
- ❌ No clear error messages
- ❌ Permission issues with storage access

### After Fix:
- ✅ Shared file downloads work properly
- ✅ Clear error messages for access issues
- ✅ Proper permission validation
- ✅ Better user experience with toast notifications

## Troubleshooting

If downloads still don't work:

1. **Check Browser Console**: Look for error messages and logs
2. **Verify API Endpoint**: Ensure `/api/download/[id]` is accessible
3. **Check Permissions**: Verify the file is properly shared
4. **Test with Debug Button**: Use the "Test Download" button in debug section
5. **Check Network Tab**: Look for failed API requests

## Next Steps

1. Test the download functionality with real shared files
2. Monitor for any remaining issues
3. Remove debug sections once confirmed working
4. Add download analytics if needed
5. Consider adding download progress indicators
